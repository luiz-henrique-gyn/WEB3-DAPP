# WEB3-DAPP
 🚀 Exploring Web3 on Big Brother! 🌐

Today, I'm excited to share a snippet of code I developed for an interactive Web3 application based on Big Brother. This project uses the web3 library to interact with Ethereum smart contracts, allowing users to vote for their favorite participants!

This code includes functionality for wallet authentication using Metamask, obtaining the smart contract, and interacting with methods such as getCurrentVoting and addVote. I'm focused on good security practices, error handling, and a fluid user experience.

Feel free to explore the full repo on my GitHub profile and try this Web3 experience for yourself! If you have feedback or suggestions, I'd love to hear them.

In the near future we can have elections based on fair open voting and 100 secure and transparent audits thanks to the cutting-edge technology of Blockchain
